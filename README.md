# pmpc

poor man's presenter console -- a sort of spork of
[pdf-presenter-console](https://github.com/davvil/pdfpc). It's not a
fork, it's a...spork.

Intended for presentations with a laptop and projector, with one screen
being projected and another with speaker notes and slide previews.

# ideas, todo

put all the LaTeX support stuff in a .sty file

eventually put a timer on the presentation screen too

notes for slides with overlays only appear for last overlay

hmm: I think if you compare page labels and page indices, you can figure
it out: http://people.freedesktop.org/~ajohnson/docs/poppler-glib/PopplerPage.html#poppler-page-get-label
