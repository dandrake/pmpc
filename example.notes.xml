<!--
Entire thing enclosed in <notes>.

Each <note> needs a slide attribute which corresponds to the 0-based
page number in the PDF.

Since ampersands are escape characters in XML, Python's parser won't
accept anything with a bare "&" (outside of comments!); write &amp; if
you really want & in your notes.
