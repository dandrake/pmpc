<!--
Entire thing enclosed in <notes>.

Each <note> needs a slide attribute which corresponds to the 0-based
page number in the PDF.

Since ampersands are escape characters in XML, Python's parser won't
accept anything with a bare "&" (outside of comments!); write &amp; if
you really want & in your notes.

Same thing goes for < -- use &lt; if you really want to see a less-than
symbol. (Strictly speaking, XML allows bare > symbols, so you're okay
there, but it is good practice to use &gt; instead.)

multiple note elements with the same slide attribute will get
concatenated with a blank line separating them.

yet still more notes.
